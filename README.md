# Coinbase Go SDK


The Coinbase Go SDK enables the simple integration of crypto into your app. By calling Coinbase's Platform APIs, the SDK allows you to create Go representations of crypto addresses and stake with those addresses.

The SDK supports various verbs on End-User-custodied Wallets across multiple networks, as documented [here](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/cdp-sdk/docs/networks).

**CDP SDK v0 is a pre-alpha release, which means that the APIs and SDK methods are subject to change. We will continuously release updates to support new capabilities and improve the developer experience.**
